# Milestone 1 – User Authentication System

## Project Title
Infosys Springboard – Policy Navigation Using AI (Milestone 1)

## Description

In this milestone, we developed a secure User Authentication System using Streamlit.  
The system allows users to register, log in securely, access a dashboard, and reset their password.

JWT (JSON Web Token) was used to implement secure login functionality.

## Features Implemented

- User Signup with input validation
- Secure Login using JWT authentication
- Dashboard page after successful login
- Forgot Password functionality
- Session handling
- Error handling for invalid credentials
