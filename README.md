# Infosys Springboard: Policy Navigation Using AI

## Project Description
This repository is created as part of the **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0 – Batch 13**.  
The project focuses on utilizing **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to streamline the navigation and analysis of public policy documents, making them easier to understand and search.

The project is being developed milestone-wise.

**Milestone 1 – Secure User Authentication System** has been successfully implemented, which includes:
- User Signup with validation  
- Secure Login using JWT authentication  
- Dashboard after successful login  
- Forgot Password functionality using Security Question  
- SQLite database integration  
- Ngrok used for demonstration (authentication token removed before upload)

The implementation for Milestone 1 is available inside the `milestone1/` folder.
